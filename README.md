RAML Linter
===========

RAML does not enforce any rules on how to document an API but many larger
organizations, or companies, would benefit from being able to enforce some
consistent standards across many APIs. This linter will allow configuration
through an "opt-in" strategy of validation rules.

## Getting Started (install)

```
npm install
```

## Running

An example run is setup in the npm scripts.

```
npm run drapi
```
